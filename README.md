## Problem Statement
Cities often face congestion due to poor understanding of traffic patterns.  
This project analyzes **traffic datasets** to identify peak traffic hours, trends, and anomalies, while also predicting peak periods.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze **traffic density** over time.
- Identify **peak hours** and **best routes**.
- Study the impact of **weather** and **accidents** on traffic.
- Predict **peak traffic periods** using regression.

---

##  Dataset
The dataset should include the following columns:

- `timestamp` → Date & time of record  
- `location_id` → Location identifier  
- `traffic_volume` → Total traffic volume  
- `avg_vehicle_speed` → Average vehicle speed  
- `vehicle_count_cars` → Number of cars  
- `vehicle_count_trucks` → Number of trucks  
- `vehicle_count_bikes` → Number of bikes  
- `weather_condition` → Sunny, Rainy, Fog, etc.  
- `temperature` → Temperature in °C  
- `humidity` → Humidity percentage  
- `accident_reported` → 0 (No accident), 1 (Accident occurred)  
- `signal_status` → Signal light status (Green/Red/Yellow)  

---

##  Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** → Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** → Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** → Regression modeling  

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
